# Fetch

This project is a single-page-application that will generate random dog pictures, provided by this [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/)

Fetch will allow users to do the following:
- View all available dog breeds via the homepage
- Filter through the dog breeds via a searchbar
- Click a specific dog breed and view four random pictures of dogs of that breed
    - Navigate back to the list page without a page refresh
